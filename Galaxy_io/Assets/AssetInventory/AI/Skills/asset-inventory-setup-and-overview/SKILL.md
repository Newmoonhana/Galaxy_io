# Asset Inventory Setup and Overview

Open Asset Inventory, confirm its catalog state and configured sources, and route the request without assuming where the package is installed.

## When to use this skill

- Opening the main Asset Inventory window.
- Choosing an initial indexing path and checking readiness.
- Routing searches, organization, imports, audits, exports, and automation.

## Prerequisites

- Asset Inventory is imported into a Unity 2022.3 or newer project.
- A live Unity Editor is available; batch and headless catalog behavior is not a supported customer contract.

## Quick start

1. Open `Tools > Asset Inventory > Asset Inventory`.
2. Alternatively use `Window > Package Management > Asset Inventory` or `Window > Asset Inventory`.
3. If the catalog is empty, choose automatic or choose-first indexing and let the initial actions complete.
4. Select the narrowest sibling skill for the requested outcome.

## Workflows

### Workflow: Open and assess readiness

1. Open the main window.
2. Check whether indexing is complete or resumable.
3. Review configured Asset Store, package, project, and additional-folder sources.
4. Resolve any visible not-ready state before searching or mutating.

### Workflow: Choose a workflow

1. Use Search for indexed files and media.
2. Use Packages for package-level discovery, versions, and maintenance.
3. Use Reporting, dependency, validator, action, or export surfaces only when their focused job is requested.

## Verification

- The main window opens without Console errors.
- Catalog statistics or a clear setup state are visible.
- The intended sources are enabled and their paths remain valid.
- No indexing or mutation was started outside the user's stated scope.

## API quick reference

- Main menu: `Tools > Asset Inventory > Asset Inventory`.
- Alternative menus: `Window > Package Management > Asset Inventory` and `Window > Asset Inventory`.
- Project context menu: `Assets > Asset Inventory`.
- Automation queries initialize the catalog on demand but UI commands still require a live Editor.

## Common issues

- **The catalog is not ready:** Complete or resume the visible indexing setup before relying on results.
- **A source path moved:** Use Asset Inventory's source or additional-folder relocation workflow rather than editing database paths.
- **Two Editors are open:** Target the intended project explicitly for any CLI or MCP operation.

## Boundaries

- Do not use or expose experimental semantic or code-search surfaces.
- Do not assume the package lives under `Assets/_Tools` or any fixed import path.
- Do not alter database schema or upgrader versions for ordinary use.
- Use preview-bound confirmation for every automation mutation.
