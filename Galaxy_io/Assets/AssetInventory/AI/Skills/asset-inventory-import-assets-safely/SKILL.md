# Import Assets Safely

Preflight an exact catalog item, preview dependencies and destination scope, then import or place it with explicit confirmation and post-import verification.

## When to use this skill

- Importing one indexed file or a selected package subset.
- Downloading and monitoring an Asset Store package.
- Adding an already imported prefab or model to the active scene.

## Prerequisites

- The exact package and file identity are verified.
- Destination, dependency inclusion, overwrite behavior, and active scene are known.

## Quick start

1. Inspect the target's details, preview, source path, and dependencies.
2. Choose a project-relative destination under `Assets`.
3. Run the mutation as a dry run and review its exact scope.
4. Execute only with the matching confirmation token, then verify imported assets and scene state.

## Workflows

### Workflow: Import an indexed file

1. Resolve one exact indexed file.
2. Preview destination, dependencies, collisions, and package-relative paths.
3. Run the default dry run.
4. Repeat the unchanged request with execution enabled and the returned token.
5. Verify imported files, GUID handling, and Console state.

### Workflow: Place an imported asset in the scene

1. Confirm the prefab or model is already under the project's `Assets` directory.
2. Resolve one active loaded scene and an unambiguous parent.
3. Preview the scene placement and coordinates.
4. Execute with confirmation, then verify Undo and scene dirty state.

## Verification

- Imported paths remain inside the project `Assets` directory.
- Only previewed dependencies and targets were created or updated.
- Existing GUID and collision behavior is reported.
- Scene placement targets one active scene and is undoable.

## API quick reference

- Automation mutations include starting a download, importing a file, adding an imported asset to the active scene, and exporting data.
- Mutations default to `DryRun = true`.
- Execution requires the current SHA-256 confirmation token and unchanged validated scope.
- Download progress is available through a separate read-only query.

## Common issues

- **Confirmation mismatch:** The scope changed after preview; accept the replacement preview and use its new token.
- **Destination is rejected:** Choose a normalized project path under `Assets` without traversal.
- **Scene parent is ambiguous:** Use a unique parent or omit it and provide deterministic coordinates.

## Boundaries

- Never bypass dry-run confirmation.
- Do not import from an unverified name-only match.
- Do not overwrite existing user assets unless the preview makes that scope explicit.
- Do not place objects into an ambiguous or unloaded scene.
